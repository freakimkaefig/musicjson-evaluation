dva - Evaluation of Top 10
==================================================
This subproject evaluates similarity scores for top 10 of the subcollection "dva" of the Essen Folksong Collection available from [KernScores](http://kern.humdrum.org/cgi-bin/browse?l=/essen/europa).

The list of Top 10 is retrieved from 2015-shapetime algorithm of the [MelodyShape](https://github.com/julian-urbano/MelodyShape)-Implementation by Julian Urbano [[1]](#sources).
The top 10 pair results are compared with those from the custom implemented algorithms ms, gar, interval and parson.

For general information, what the repository is about, have a look at [Project root](https://github.com/freakimkaefig/musicjson-evaluation).
